# Elon Musk the Enterpreuner
Elon Musk shows his first ambitions and his extraordinary behaviour right at his teenage years from leaving his home in South Africa to join Queen's University in Canada to get a degree in economics and physics. His reasons for leaving his homeland in his words was that he demised the idea of being a part of a racist army.
Later he pursued a PhD in applied physics and material sciences to leave the program just two days later to start on business foundation and then reselling businesses starting from _Zip2_ in 1995 which was sold later to _Compaq_ in 1999, _PayPal_ which was sold to _eBay_ in 2002.
Musk describes himself as an engineer and enterpreuner who tackles environmental, social and economic challenges. He is the COO at three ventures naming _SolarCity_, _SpaceX_, and _Tesla Motors_. The former two are performing well leading the market in residential solar panels and space exploration.
# Tesla Motors
The company was founded in 2003 in San Carlos as an automobile company dedicated to make electric vehicles. The company's first hit or miss trials was a big miss by over 50,000\$ due to an error in pricing by the former CE0 Martin Ederhard. Tesla later fired Ederhard after finding that the model has serious safety issues adding to the huge mistake in pricing which led the company to lose 50,000\$ per vehicle.
## The Transormation in Strategy
After that the major milestone for the company was to decide that every important system on the car, including the body, motor, power electronics, transmission, battery pack, and HVAC had to be redesigned or switched to a new supplier.

## Models
Tesla Motors began on a journey to make their vehicles starting with _Roadster_ which was later stopped for the better _Model S_ a family sedan. Tesla made profit by increasing the efficiency and reliability of an electric car to an extent that it was comparable to its peers of gasoline cars. Some actually exceed some of the perfomance aspects of even sports cars.

## Profit
Tesla profited from selling units as well as selling stocks, but despite that the company annually reported a loss  untill year 2013. The profit was due to in Musk's words due to improving manufacturing process and maturity of the supply chain, as well as cutting down manufacturing time by 40\% , and improving inventory management.
